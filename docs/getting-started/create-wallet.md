# Create a Wallet

## Prerequisites ##

* If you have not already installed the Dropil Chain cli, please refer to [Installing Dropil Chain](install) before continuing. Alternatively, you may choose to skip this step and create a wallet from another source.

## Creating a Wallet ##
Creating a wallet through the dropcli is very simple. 

Execute the following command in your command prompt of choosing:

```
dropcli keys add <KEYNAME>
```

Replace `<KEYNAME>` with a unique identifier of your choosing.

You will be prompted to enter a password (text will be hidden while you type) to encrypt the generated key to your disk. Do not forget this.

Copy the password you chose and the output to a secure location. Do not forget to copy the 24 word mnemonic provided when creating the key.

## Congratulations! ##
You have now created a Dropil wallet.
