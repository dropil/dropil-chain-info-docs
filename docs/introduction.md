Welcome to the Dropil Chain documentation! The purpose of these docs are to provide information on the technology and how to use it. These docs are a work in progress and will see regular updates.

Dropil Chain is a Proof-of-Stake blockchain built using the powerful Cosmos SDK and plans to play a role in the inter-blockchain communication protocol (IBC) which allows cross-chain transfers between other blockchains. Learn all about [Cosmos Hub](https://hub.cosmos.network/) and [Cosmos SDK](https://cosmos.network/sdk).

## The DROP
Dropil Chain's native currency is the DROP (aka Drops & Dropil). Drops give users the ability to contribute to Dropil Chain and help propel the network through staking and delegation. Delegate Drops to any validator to earn more Drops through the Proof-of-Stake algorithm Dropil Chain is built on. By staking and/or delegating, you also gain the ability to vote on proposals and affect the future of the chain.
