# Other Resources

Because Dropil Chain is built using the Cosmos SDK and a lot of the information contained in these docs are based on their Cosmos Hub documentation, these docs are not exhaustive in all topics regarding the underlying technology of Dropil Chain. Please refer to these additional resources to get more information as most of the information on these resources directly translates to Dropil Chain. Most of the differences between Dropil Chain and Cosmos can be found by reading the differences in the genesis file and the current modules that Dropil Chain supports.
